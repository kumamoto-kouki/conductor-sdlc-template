# Task Generation Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Natural Language Descriptions

Focus on capabilities and outcomes, not code structure.

**Describe**:

- What functionality to achieve
- Business logic and behavior
- Features and capabilities
- Domain language and concepts
- Data relationships and workflows

**Avoid**:

- File paths and directory structure
- Function/method names and signatures
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Class names and API contracts
- Specific data structures

**Rationale**: Implementation details (files, methods, types) are defined in design.md. Tasks describe the functional work to be done.

### 2. Task Ordering Principle

**Order implies dependency**: Task N implicitly depends on all tasks before it. This is the primary dependency mechanism.

**Tasks must follow this phase order**:

1. **Foundation**: Environment setup, test infrastructure, shared utilities, database schema, configuration
2. **Core**: Primary feature implementation (parallel-capable tasks grouped here)
3. **Integration**: Wiring components together, cross-boundary connections
4. **Validation**: E2E tests, edge cases, regression checks

**Rationale**: Foundation work unblocks everything else. Placing setup tasks early prevents downstream blocking. Core tasks can often run in parallel because foundation is already complete.

### 3. Task Integration & Progression

**Every task must**:

- Build on previous outputs (no orphaned code)
- Connect to the overall system (no hanging features)
- Progress incrementally (no big jumps in complexity)
- Respect architecture boundaries defined in design.md (Architecture Pattern & Boundary Map)
- Honor interface contracts documented in design.md
- Use major task summaries sparingly—omit detail bullets if the work is fully captured by child tasks.

**End with integration tasks** to wire everything together.

### 4. Dependency Declaration

**Default**: Sequential ordering handles most dependencies (task N depends on tasks before it).

**Explicit declaration required when**:

- A task depends on a specific task in a different major-task group (cross-boundary)
- The dependency is non-obvious from ordering alone
- A task can skip ahead of its position (declared via `(P)`) but still needs specific prior work

**Format**: `_Depends: 1.2, 2.3_` — placed alongside `_Requirements:_` in task detail sections.

**Do not over-annotate**: If a task simply depends on the task directly before it, ordering alone is sufficient.

### 4.5 Model Annotation (optional)

Add `_Model: <haiku|sonnet|opus|fable>_` only when a task calls for a model other than the implementer's default (e.g. an architecture-sensitive task that warrants `opus`, or a mechanical sweep that only needs `haiku`). Judge by task shape, not by role -- see `.claude/playbooks/model-assignment.md` for the cost/effort tradeoffs behind the choice.

### 5. Boundary Scope

**Each task should declare its component boundary** using design.md component/module names:

- `_Boundary: AuthService_` or `_Boundary: API Layer, UserRepository_`
- Helps validate parallel safety: tasks with non-overlapping boundaries are parallel candidates
- Helps agents understand scope: what to touch and what not to touch

**When to use**: Recommended wherever scope is not obvious from the description; include it whenever you mark a task `(P)`.

**Boundary rule**:

- Each executable task should stay within a single responsibility boundary
- If work must cross boundaries, make it an explicit integration task rather than a normal implementation task
- Do not hide cross-boundary coordination inside a task that appears local

### 6. Flexible Task Sizing

**Guidelines**:

- **Major tasks**: As many sub-tasks as logically needed (group by cohesion)
- **Sub-tasks**: 1-3 hours each, 3-10 details per sub-task
- Balance between too granular and too broad

**Don't force arbitrary numbers** - let logical grouping determine structure.

### 7. Requirements Mapping

**End each task detail section with**:

- `_Requirements: X.X, Y.Y_` listing **only numeric requirement IDs** (comma-separated). Never append descriptive text, parentheses, translations, or free-form labels.
- For cross-cutting requirements, list every relevant requirement ID. All requirements MUST have numeric IDs in requirements.md. If an ID is missing, stop and correct requirements.md before generating tasks.
- Reference components/interfaces from design.md when helpful (e.g., `_Contracts: AuthService API`)

### 7.5 Observable Completion

**Each executable task must include at least one detail bullet that describes the observable completed state**:

- Phrase it as a deliverable, runtime behavior, persisted state, UI state, endpoint behavior, test result, or integration outcome
- Avoid vague bullets like "implement support", "wire things up", or "handle logic" unless paired with a concrete observable result
- Prefer making one detail bullet clearly answer: "What will be true when this task is done?"
- Keep this within the existing task body; do not add extra bookkeeping fields

### 8. Code-Only Focus

**Include ONLY**:

- Coding tasks (implementation)
- Testing tasks (unit, integration, E2E)
- Technical setup tasks (infrastructure, configuration)

**Exclude**:

- Deployment tasks
- Documentation tasks
- User testing
- Marketing/business activities

## Task Plan Review Gate

Before writing `tasks.md`, review the draft task plan and repair local issues until the plan passes or a true spec gap is discovered.

### Coverage Review

- Every requirement ID from `requirements.md` must appear in at least one task.
- Every design component, interface/contract, integration point, runtime prerequisite, and validation concern from `design.md` must be represented by at least one task.
- If coverage is missing because the task plan is incomplete, repair the draft tasks and review again.
- If coverage cannot be added cleanly because requirements or design are ambiguous, contradictory, or underspecified, stop and return to the requirements/design phase instead of papering over the gap in `tasks.md`.

### Executability Review

- Every sub-task must be executable as written, usually within 1-3 hours.
- Every sub-task must produce a verifiable deliverable (behavior, artifact, endpoint, UI state, config, migration, test, or integration result).
- Every executable sub-task must include at least one detail bullet that states the observable completion condition.
- Split tasks that combine multiple independently verifiable outcomes.
- Split tasks that combine multiple responsibility boundaries unless they are explicit integration tasks.
- If many tasks require broad `_Boundary:_` scopes or repeated cross-boundary coordination, stop and return to design or roadmap decomposition instead of forcing the spec through task generation.
- Merge or collapse tasks that are too small, bookkeeping-only, or not meaningful execution units.
- Make implicit prerequisites explicit as preceding tasks.
- Re-check `_Depends:_`, `_Boundary:_`, and `(P)` markers after edits so concurrency claims still match the design boundaries and dependency graph.

### Review Loop

- Run the review gate on the draft task plan before writing `tasks.md`.
- If issues are task-plan-local, repair the draft and re-run the review gate.
- Keep the loop bounded: no more than 2 review-and-repair passes before escalating a real spec gap.
- Write `tasks.md` only after the review gate passes.

### Optional Test Coverage Tasks

- When the design already guarantees functional coverage and rapid MVP delivery is prioritized, mark purely test-oriented follow-up work (e.g., baseline rendering/unit tests) as **optional** using the `- [ ]*` checkbox form.
- Only apply the optional marker when the sub-task directly references acceptance criteria from requirements.md in its detail bullets.
- Never mark implementation work or integration-critical verification as optional—reserve `*` for auxiliary/deferrable test coverage that can be revisited post-MVP.

## Task Hierarchy Rules

### Maximum 2 Levels

- **Level 1**: Major tasks (1, 2, 3, 4...)
- **Level 2**: Sub-tasks (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2...)
- **No deeper nesting** (no 1.1.1)
- If a major task would contain only a single actionable item, collapse the structure and promote the sub-task to the major level (e.g., replace `1.1` with `1.`).
- When a major task exists purely as a container, keep the checkbox description concise and avoid duplicating detailed bullets—reserve specifics for its sub-tasks.

### Sequential Numbering

- Major tasks MUST increment: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
- Sub-tasks reset per major task: 1.1, 1.2, then 2.1, 2.2...
- Never repeat major task numbers

### Parallel Marker `(P)` (optional, informational)

`(P)` after a task number (e.g. `- [ ] 2.1 (P) Build background worker`) notes that the task has no dependency on its immediately preceding peers. Marking it is **optional**: the current execution system does not consume it — `kiro-impl` always runs tasks sequentially and treats `(P)` as informational (see its SKILL.md). Actual parallelism in this template happens at the multi-spec wave level via `/kiro-spec-batch`, not between tasks inside one spec. If you do mark `(P)`: keep it outside the checkbox brackets, give the task a `_Boundary:_` annotation, declare cross-boundary prerequisites with `_Depends: X.X_` (the dependency declaration matters for execution order regardless of `(P)`), and omit `(P)` entirely when `--sequential` is requested.

### Checkbox Format

```markdown
- [ ] 1. Foundation: environment and test infrastructure setup
- [ ] 1.1 Sub-task description

  - _Boundary: AuthService_

- [ ] 2.2 (P) Sub-task description
  - Detail items...
  - Observable completion condition
  - _Requirements: Z.Z_
  - _Boundary: UserRepository_

- [ ] 3. Integration and wiring
- [ ] 3.1 Sub-task description
  - Detail items...
  - Observable completion condition
  - _Depends: 2.1, 2.2_
  - _Requirements: W.W_
```

## Requirements Coverage

**Mandatory Check**:

- ALL requirements from requirements.md MUST be covered
- Cross-reference every requirement ID with task mappings
- If gaps found: Return to requirements or design phase
- No requirement should be left without corresponding tasks

Requirement-ID format is defined once in `kiro-spec-requirements`'s `rules/ears-format.md` (`## Requirement IDs (Canonical Rule)`); follow it — numeric `N.M` only, no restating here.

Document any intentionally deferred requirements with rationale.
